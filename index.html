                  The website you always wanted...we do it all - we will help
                  you write the text, commission the photos (or take some
                  ourselves) talk you through what you need, and come up with
                  your own best website. And it will work on the widest range of
                  devices and browsers possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Or perhaps you have an old website you're particularly fond of
                  but it doesn't work in iphones, tablets, or anything other
                  than a traditional computer screen? We'll overhaul the design
                  and upgrade your website to be fully responsive. Or if you
                  prefer, we can even duplicate your old website so it will look
                  the same but work fully in all devices - the choice is yours.
                  We are also a Registered Provider with NBSL and can help you
                  apply for funding to their new funding scheme. If you are in
                  Northumberland, North Tyneside or Newcastle council areas and
                  meet their criteria then

                <p>
                  We write websites from scratch using code (mainly HTML5, CSS3,
                  JavaScript and PHP) because we like to have full control over
                  our own code. This will give you full control over your
                  website...If something goes wrong after an edit, we can
                  usually fix it in seconds by getting straight back into the
                  code and adjusting something. The tech that we work with also
                  includes various JavaScript 'frameworks' or 'libraries',
                  mainly React & React Native and styling libraries such as
                  Material UI, Bootstrap etc which help to ensure that your
                  website will be fully valid and responsive and it will
                  work as you intend it to in the widest possible range of
                  browsers and devices (tablets, smart phones, desktop computers
                  etc). And we offer the Content Management System that will
                  work best for you, either a system such as cushycms that
                  offers basic editing options which can be included in your
                  package, up to custom wordpress style editing dashboards that
                  we design especially for you. And throughout it all we work within Humane Technology principles
                  meaning we consider the people using it and its impact on them, and aim to make technology
                  comfortable, minimally-intrusive, and non-stigmatizing. We don't use infinite scrolling, click bait
                  etc, because people don't like it and it's not good for them! We aim to look after your users so that
                  they continue being your users.

                          working freelance for some time after that I had a brief

                          30 and need a proper job' job) before settling at
                          Riverside Independent Music Venue for the next 4 years,
                          where I worked my way up to the post of Assistant
                          Director. After leaving Riverside I worked freelance
                          again, gaining experience in other artforms and areas. I
                          then joined Northern Arts, as the Arts Council England
                          northern office was then known. I started as the 'Arts
                          for Everyone Co-ordinator', then was seconded to
                          coordinate Radio One Sound City in Newcastle - an
                          amazing experience! Then I became 'Special Projects
                          Officer' and after a few more years of freelance Arts
                          Consultancy covering a wide range of really interesting
                          work and working as a salsa dance instructor/dancer I
                          had some some time off with a major illness (now
                          recovered) and then I was ready for a change. After
                          retraining at the Inchbald School of Design in London as
                          an Architectural Interior Designer in 2006 I moved to
                          Spain for nearly 5 years, where I renovated property.
                          After that market somewhat dried up in 2010, I returned
                          to the uk to family commitments. As those commitments
                          became more manageable, I retrained again as a qualified
                          web designer/developer. In the last 10 years I've worked
                          sometimes full time, sometimes part time around family
                          commitments and health issues (2 bouts of Long Covid and
                          a spinal injury) - but nothing keeps me down for long!

                          Throughout my working life I have worked on music both
                          in my spare time and in my career - originally singing &
                          playing guitar in various bands, and then promoting
                          salsa music nights. I then moved on to DJing and dancing
                          salsa, promoting regular salsa nights, and holding/being
                          hired to run dance classes & dance exhibitions with my
                          dance & DJ partners while holding down a freelance
                          career as an Arts Manager/Consultant. After a major
                          accident I could no longer dance for a living - now my
                          interests centre more around cycling, travel (my
                          favourite trip so far? A 6 month sabbatical backpacking
                          round the world!), and remaining fluent in Spanish after
                          spending 4 years living in Spain. I still sing & play
                          guitar and I'm continuing to build my collection of
                          salsa and other music. I now also am a keen activist for
                          the Green Party and manage the local group's website and
                          other tech/design responsibilities. I also remain
                          involved in various arts initiatives in an advisory
                          capacity and am Chair of the Board of the Globe Gallery
                          - a visual art gallery based in North Shields.

                          work and working as a salsa dance instructor/dancer I
                          had some some time off with a major illness (now
                          recovered) and then I was ready for a change. After
                          retraining at the Inchbald School of Design in London as
                          an Architectural Interior Designer in 2006 I moved to
                          Spain for nearly 5 years, where I renovated property.
                          After that market somewhat dried up in 2010, I returned
                          to the uk to family commitments. As those commitments
                          became more manageable, I retrained again as a qualified
                          web designer/developer. In the last 10 years I've worked
                          sometimes full time, sometimes part time around family
                          commitments and health issues (2 bouts of Long Covid and
                          a spinal injury) - but nothing keeps me down for long!

                          Throughout my working life I have worked on music both
                          in my spare time and in my career - originally singing &
                          playing guitar in various bands, and then promoting
                          salsa music nights. I then moved on to DJing and dancing
                          salsa, promoting regular salsa nights, and holding/being
                          hired to run dance classes & dance exhibitions with my
                          dance & DJ partners while holding down a freelance
                          career as an Arts Manager/Consultant. After a major
                          accident I could no longer dance for a living - now my
                          interests centre more around cycling, travel (my
                          favourite trip so far? A 6 month sabbatical backpacking
                          round the world!), and remaining fluent in Spanish after
                          spending 4 years living in Spain. I still sing & play
                          guitar and I'm continuing to build my collection of
                          salsa and other music. I now also am a keen activist for
                          the Green Party and manage the local group's website and
                          other tech/design responsibilities. I also remain
                          involved in various arts initiatives in an advisory
                          capacity and am Chair of the Board of the Globe Gallery
                          - a visual art gallery based in North Shields.

                you

                Very dependant on the project, prices are extremely variable as
                apps can obviously run from very simple to extremely complex. We
                can show you pre-made templates that we can customise
                for you so you can get your app up and running for a fraction of
                the price of a custom built app. Or we can design it from the
                ground up for you. Prices vary according to size and complexity.
                Talk to us about your ideas and we'll come up with a fully
                itemised quote for you with no obligation.
