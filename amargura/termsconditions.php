  <h2>CALLE AMARGURA 11: HOLIDAY LET TERMS AND CONDITIONS </h2>
<a href="bookings.php" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg active" role="button">back to bookings</a>
  <p align="center">PLEASE NOTE THAT &lsquo;CALLE AMARGURA 11&rsquo; IS A <strong>NO SMOKING</strong> PROPERTY (see below, point &lsquo;7&rsquo;.)</p>
  <p><strong> 1. Period of Let.</strong><br />
The period of let is from 3pm on the first day of the booking period through to 10am on the last day of the booking period. We request that you vacate the property by 10am to facilitate the departure inspection (which ensures you receive your deposit back as soon as possible via the method you used to pay) and cleaning for the next clients. We reserve the right to retain a portion of your security deposit to cover the costs of extra staff to ensure cleaning is completed on time if you have not vacated by 10am.) </p>

  <p><strong>2.&nbsp; Booking and payment.</strong><br />
    You can make your booking online at our website www.amargura11.com and this will be confirmed on payment of 33% of the total due. The balance must be made by three weeks before the first date of your holiday. If the total due is not paid by this date, we reserve the right to release the dates to someone else and retain the full sum of your deposit (i.e. 33% of the total due) towards the cost of potential lost income and inconvenience. Please note that your booking is not confirmed until we have received the deposit, and we will only hold the dates for you without payment of this for a period of 4 days from the date of reservation. If you have not paid by this time we will release the dates and you will have to re-book. You will receive an invoice for the deposit within 24 hours of booking dates on the webpage (if for any reason you don't receive the invoice please email us on calleamargura11@gmail.com - but please check your spam folder first!). If you do not wish to pay by paypal then you can pay by bank transfer into our account - if you wish to pay by this method please email us on info@amargura11.com to request our bank account details.</p>
  <p><strong>3.Damages Deposit.</strong><br />
    We request a security/damages deposit of £500 for your stay at Calle Amargura 11. This is to cover any damages or breakages that may occur during your stay. Our representatives in Spain will carry out an inspection on the date of your departure, immediately after you hand back the keys and before cleaning commences. If they find any damage or breakages they will inform us and we will calculate the cost of repair/replacement and deduct this from your deposit then refund the balance (providing there is of course a balance after the costs have been deducted). The deposit or portion of deposit will be refunded within 10 days of the end of your holiday (maximum) and usually within a couple of days. If you accidentally break a glass or a plate for instance, then please just inform our reps on departure - we won't retain money for small breakages or every day wear and tear within reason. However, please note that we will report any acts of vandalism or deliberate damage to the local police as well as retaining your security deposit. </p>
  <p><strong>4. Cleaning and Linen.</strong><br />
    We provide clean bedlinen for all guests (2 double beds, and if booking for 6 people, one double sofabed), and we also provide towels ONLY for use in the house so please bring your own beach towels.&nbsp; Please note that if the towels are damaged by use by the pool or beach the cost will be retained from your security deposit. Please note that we do not provide additional clean bedlinen during your stay, but so that you can wash items yourself the property does have a large washing machine and separate drier, as well as a rotary clothes line that dries linen in a couple of hours during the summer months! Additionally there is a vacuum cleaner, bucket and mops and cleaning materials in the house for your use if required. If you require a maid service to change the bedding during your stay, or to provide additional cleaning then please request this on booking and we will make the arrangements for you for a small additional cost (please enquire for price list). If you use additional bedding (more than one set per couple) or towels (one hand &amp; one bath towel per person plus an extra bath towel per couple) and do not wash it and return it to the bedding store then we will have to charge you an additional fee of £20 for each additional set of bedding used (which is what it costs us to have it laundered in time for the next guests to use, who usually arrive later on the day you leave).</p>
  <p><strong>5. Beds</strong><br />
    Please note that there are only two double beds in the property, one in each of the two double bedrooms, and no single beds are available.&nbsp; If you are a party of 6 then we can accommodate you, but only by two of the guests using the sofabed in the TV room.&nbsp; The sofabed is a comfortable sprung type and can be made up as a bed in advance of your arrival, or otherwise we can leave bedding in the dressing room upstairs and you can convert the sofa into a bed yourselves each evening.&nbsp; There is also plenty of wardrobe/drawer space in the dressing room upstairs for an additional two guests to share this room with the guests in the upstairs bedroom.&nbsp; However, please be clear that for the house to accommodate 6, two people must sleep on the sofabed in the TV room, and must store their belongings either in that room, or in the (shared) dressing room upstairs.&nbsp; The TV room is a separate room and the door can remain closed at all times to function as a bedroom if this is preferred (it is also possible to move the small TV/DVD player into the main reception room for the duration of the holiday - please ask if you would like us to arrange this prior to your arrival).</p>
  <p><strong>6. Insurance.</strong><br />
  &nbsp;We have public liability insurance but our house/contents insurance does not cover guests' belongings so we strongly recommend you take out your own holiday insurance for this. Likewise the Spanish health system treats all European citizens so you are entitled to healthcare while you are in Spain, but you must have your European Health Insurance Card, which you can apply for online or via an application form available from main post offices in the UK. Without this card the local doctors or hospitals are unlikely to see you so it's very important to ensure you have it. </p>
  <p><strong>7. Smoking</strong><br />
    Please note that Calle Amargura 11 is a NO SMOKING house!&nbsp; We request that you not smoke anywhere on the property, even in the outside areas (this is due to the fact that smoke will always come into the house as windows and doors are naturally left open in the warm weather).&nbsp; This is so that we can offer the house as a non-smoking house to those who require it for health reasons as well as for preference, and also because the owner suffers from severe asthma, and cannot use the house if there has been a smoker staying in it.&nbsp; If you do smoke in the house please be aware that we reserve the right to withhold a portion of your security deposit to cover the cost of additional cleaning.</p>
  <p><strong>8.&nbsp; Single-sex parties.</strong> <br />
    Please note that we do not accept parties made up of all male or all female guests unless by special arrangement.&nbsp; Calle Amargura is a terraced family home in the centre of a small village and as such is not suitable for hen/stag parties or similar celebrations! </p>
  <p><strong>9. Internet, TV etc.</strong><br />
    We provide a tv set that has a built in DVD player in the second reception room and wireless internet (download speed of 4Gb)<strong></strong> is also provided free of charge. Full details are in the house manual. If either of these are damaged however the cost of repair will have to be taken from the security deposit.</p>
  <p><strong>10.&nbsp; Bookings more than 6 months ahead.</strong><br />
    We accept bookings for more than 6 months ahead, but we do need to point out that we can only give absolute confirmation of the booking 6 months before the start of your holiday.&nbsp; We extremely unlikely to ever change your booking, but we have to reserve the right to do so if our circumstances change.&nbsp; Once your holiday is 6 months or less away, the booking is confirmed and binding.<strong></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>10.&nbsp; Cancellations.</strong><br />
    For bookings cancelled up to 60 days before the start of the stay, traveller receives a 100% refund. You are not charged any booking fees.  For bookings cancelled up to 30 days before the start of the stay, traveller receives a 50% refund. You are charged booking fees on any portion kept.<strong></strong></p>
